# PouchDB rollup issue

This builds 3 different bundles with various issues.
One is working but requires additional plugins to function properly.

First install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Next build and start server:

```
npm start
```

After build is complete you can visit `http://localhost:5000`,
which will have corresponding `.html` files
